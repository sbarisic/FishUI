# Project Name - TODO

A list of planned features, improvements, and tasks for this project.

> **CPX (Complexity Points)** - 1 to 5 scale:
> - **1** - Single file control/component
> - **2** - Single file control/component with single function change dependencies
> - **3** - Multi-file control/component or single file with multiple dependencies, no architecture changes
> - **4** - Multi-file control/component with multiple dependencies and significant logic, possible minor architecture changes
> - **5** - Large feature spanning multiple components and subsystems, major architecture changes

> Instructions for the TODO list:
- Move all completed items into separate Completed section
- Consolidate all completed TODO items by combining similar ones and shortening the descriptions where possible

> How TODO file should be iterated:
- First handle the Uncategorized section, if any similar issues already are on the TODO list, increase their priority instead of adding duplicates (categorize all at once)
- When Uncategorized section is empty, start by fixing Active Bugs (take one at a time)
- After Active Bugs, handle the rest of the TODO file by priority and complexity (High priority takes precedance, then CPX points) (take one at a time).
